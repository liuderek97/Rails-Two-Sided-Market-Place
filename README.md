# Two Way Marketplace Ideas/Feasibility Assessment

## Bike/Scooter Rental

Scooter rental system that allows users to rent scooters and bikes in close proximity with them. User will be able to login into their account and use their current location in order to list out all the bikes/scooters that are vaccant and within close proximity to the user.

### STRENGTHS:
  * Interesting google maps api integration ideas 
  * Interesting topic for a two sided marketplace.
  
### WEAKNESSES:
  * Hard to make seem realistic /due to theft and improper application use.
  * Difficulty implementing google maps API to locate all bikes available to the users.
 
### OPPORTUNITIES:
  * Expand into a market in which there are very little competition. 
  
### THREATS:
  * Difficult to expand into a market which has very little room for new establishments
  * Risk of people getting robbed when collecting bike/scooter
  * Application pointing to a damaged bike/scooter 

## Bartender Hire 

Allow people to hire bartenders for private functions. Bartenders will be able to advertise themselves, Consumers will post a job including details  (price TBD). The Job will be listed on the main page and bartenders will be able to leave comments on the job making offers on their services.  The consumer who posted the job will then be able to choose from the list of bartenders who have offered their services.

### STRENGTHS:
  * Clear distinction between buyer and seller or provider and recepient of services.
  *	Building off of concepts and features covered in class
  * Relatively simple and achievable in the time givern
  
### WEAKNESSES:
  * Ethical issues in relation to payment. Hard to justify when the payment will take place
  * Private messaging system with the teams current skillset and rails knowledge is still foreign and will require further research in order to implement effectively

### OPPORTUNITIES:
 * There is a number off people looking to hire bartenders but at the time of making this app there is no platform available to list and offer jobs to bartenders; with the closest idea being a Facebook group/page called the Sydney Bartender Exchange in which Facebook users can list jobs and availabilities for bartneders
  
### THREATS:
 * If a larger company were to expand into the market being targeted by this site, they would easily be able to overtake the smaller site being produced by the team, as they have a wider reach and are able to establish a foothold in the market with greate ease.
 * There are already similar apps that offer users to list jobs and services and allow users to perfrom jobs and services for other people, such as Airtasker, Fiverr, and TaskRabbit. Although these services aren't specifically for barntenders and people requiring bartending services, users would still be able to utilise these applications in order to list the jobs that could be listed on the Bartending site
